# Model Prediction For oil Palm Production

Develop  a  model  that  predicts  monthly  oil  palm  production  for  January,  February  and  March  2024.  

## Parameter
<br/>• Production data have yearly seasonality. The duration of oil palm fruit production takes up to 
36 months. 
<br/>• Production  is  associated  with  its  age  (growth),  with  no  production  from  age  0  –  3,  low 
production slowly increasing from age 4 – 8, optimal production from age 9 – 15, plateauing 
production from age 16 – 20, and drop in production from age 21 onwards. 
<br/>• Production is affected by how many palms is planted in an area. Generally a bigger area would 
have more palm stand. 
<br/>• Fertiliser is a key important input for oil palm to produce fruit. Fertiliser is applied throughout 
the year with only some month having fertiliser applied. Study have shown fertiliser applied 
up to past 24 months ago can affect the production. 
<br/>• Rainfall  have  major  effects  on  production,  in  deficit  or  excessive  amount.  Monthly  rainfall 
exceeding 300mm or less than 100mm for consecutive  3 months will have severe  effect on 
the  production.  Study  have  shown  that  past  rainfall  up  to  24  months  ago  can  affect  the 
production
